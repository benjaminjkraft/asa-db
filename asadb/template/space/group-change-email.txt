{% autoescape off %}Hi {{group.name}},
    Thank you for updating space access on the ASA database today. We've forwarded the following changes on to CAC:

{% if office_msg %}
Office access:

{{office_msg}}
{% endif %}{% if locker_msgs %}
Locker (shared storage) access:
{% for msg in locker_msgs %}
{{msg}}{% endfor %}
{% endif %}

Current access summary: https://asa.mit.edu/groups/{{group.pk}}/space/

If you believe these changes are incorrect in any way, please let us know --- beyond just notifying CAC, we also want to find out why the errors happened.

Thanks,
ASA Exec

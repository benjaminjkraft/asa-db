{% autoescape off %}Hi {{group.name}},

Thank you for updating space access on the ASA database today. We are forwarding these changes to CAC, which generally updates access within [interval]. They will reply when the update has been done; if you don't get a reply, the message may have been lost and you should reply-all to this email reminding them.

We believe you made the following changes:

{% if office_msg %}
Office access:

{{office_msg}}
{% endif %}{% if locker_msgs %}
Locker (shared storage) access:
{% for msg in locker_msgs %}
{{msg}}{% endfor %}
{% endif %}

Current access summary: https://asa.mit.edu/groups/{{group.pk}}/space/

If you believe these changes are incorrect in any way, please let us know --- beyond just notifying CAC, we also want to find out why the errors happened.

Thanks,
ASA Exec

Hello again {{group.name}},
    We contacted you several months ago (see below) informing you that we
would be suspending you if you did not complete your ASA Database entry
(https://asa.mit.edu/groups/{{group.pk}}). Since your entry has not yet been
updated, we have done so.

In particular, the following problems apply:
{% for prob in problems %}* {{prob}}
{% endfor %}

In order to get your group unsuspended, you should first update your database
entry (again, at https://asa.mit.edu/groups/{{group.pk}}). Once that is
complete, you should contact us at asa-exec@mit.edu to request un-suspension.
If you have not done so within a month (that is, by August 31) we may move on
to derecognition.

Note that, at the moment, only your President (and, if set,
Treasurer and Group Admins) can update the database. If they are not
available, please contact asa-exec@mit.edu promptly, copying your president
and officers' list, and we can give additional people permission.

If you have other questions/difficulties, please don't hesitate to contact
asa-exec@mit.edu.

Thanks,
ASA Executive Board

Dear officers of {{group.name}},
   This is a followup to our previous email from a couple of weeks ago.
You have still not updated your entry in the ASA Database. We have gotten
complaints from some MIT offices (e.g., Schedules) that this is delaying
their work, and it also interferes with our own work.

*We will suspend* groups that haven't updated their records --- both main info
and listed people --- by Wednesday 3/21, unless they have contacted us at
asa-exec@mit.edu about difficulties doing so. Further penalties may follow
thereafter.

Offices (e.g., SAO, CAC, and Schedules) are already stopping checking
the old database for signatories. It's to your advantage to update the
database *before* you attempt to spend money, reserve spaces, and perform
other functions that will block on your not having updated the database.

More information about accessing and using the new Database and which
fields need to be updated is posted at: http://web.mit.edu/asa/database/.

Your group's page can be found at https://asa.mit.edu/groups/{{group.pk}}/.

In particular, we believe that your group's entry has the following issues:
[...]

We appreciate your cooperation in fixing these quickly. If you believe
this message to be in error, please be sure to contact us at
asa-exec@mit.edu.

Thanks,
The ASA Database team

Hello {{group.name}},

    We're following up on our email from July 31st (see below). You still
appear to be suspended, and are consequently currently scheduled for
derecognition *this Friday*.

The following problems (at least) exist with your database entry:
{% for prob in problems %}* {{prob}}
{% endfor %}

Please contact us (asa-exec@mit.edu) by this Friday (August 31st) if you wish
to remain active.  We prefer that you fix the listed problems first, but can
give you some extra time if needed.

You can view your ASA Database entry at
https://asa.mit.edu/groups/{{group.pk}}, and the listed president, treasurer,
and group admin can update it. If they are not available, please contact
asa-exec@mit.edu promptly, copying your president and officers' list.

If you have any questions or concerns, please contact us at asa-exec@mit.edu.
Make sure to include your group and database URL (just replying to this email
is fine).

Thanks,
Alex Dehnert
ASA Executive Board

Hello again {{group.name}},
    We contacted you several months ago (see below) informing you that we
would be suspending you if you did not complete your ASA Database entry
(https://asa.mit.edu/groups/{{group.pk}}). Since your entry has not yet been
updated, we have done so.

In particular, the following problems apply:
[...]

In order to get your group unsuspended, you should first update your database
entry (again, at https://asa.mit.edu/groups/{{group.pk}}). Once that is
complete, you should contact us at asa-exec@mit.edu to request un-suspension.
If you have not done so within a month (that is, by August 31) we may move on
to derecognition.

Note that, at the moment, only your President (and, if set,
Treasurer and Group Admins) can update the database. If they are not
available, please contact asa-exec@mit.edu promptly, copying your president
and officers' list, and we can give additional people permission.

If you have other questions/difficulties, please don't hesitate to contact
asa-exec@mit.edu.

Thanks,
ASA Executive Board

Dear officers of {{group.name}},
   This is a followup to our previous email from a couple of weeks ago.
You have still not updated your entry in the ASA Database. We have gotten
complaints from some MIT offices (e.g., Schedules) that this is delaying
their work, and it also interferes with our own work.

*We will suspend* groups that haven't updated their records --- both main info
and listed people --- by Wednesday 3/21, unless they have contacted us at
asa-exec@mit.edu about difficulties doing so. Further penalties may follow
thereafter.

Offices (e.g., SAO, CAC, and Schedules) are already stopping checking
the old database for signatories. It's to your advantage to update the
database *before* you attempt to spend money, reserve spaces, and perform
other functions that will block on your not having updated the database.

More information about accessing and using the new Database and which
fields need to be updated is posted at: http://web.mit.edu/asa/database/.

Your group's page can be found at https://asa.mit.edu/groups/{{group.pk}}/.

In particular, we believe that your group's entry has the following issues:
[...]

We appreciate your cooperation in fixing these quickly. If you believe
this message to be in error, please be sure to contact us at
asa-exec@mit.edu.

Thanks,
The ASA Database team

Hello again,
   As a reminder, you have only a couple of days (until Wed 3/21) to update
the ASA group database before we suspend your group for delinquency. Please
be sure to visit https://asa.mit.edu:444/groups/{{group.pk}}/. If your
president is not available to make this update, please email us
(asa-exec@mit.edu) ASAP, CC'ing your officers' list of record (check the To
line of this email). If you have other questions/difficulties, please don't
hesitate to contact asa-exec@mit.edu.

Thanks,
ASA Executive Board

Dear officers of {{group.name}},
   This is a followup to our previous email from a couple of weeks ago.
You have still not updated your entry in the ASA Database. We have gotten
complaints from some MIT offices (e.g., Schedules) that this is delaying
their work, and it also interferes with our own work.

*We will suspend* groups that haven't updated their records --- both main info
and listed people --- by Wednesday 3/21, unless they have contacted us at
asa-exec@mit.edu about difficulties doing so. Further penalties may follow
thereafter.

Offices (e.g., SAO, CAC, and Schedules) are already stopping checking
the old database for signatories. It's to your advantage to update the
database *before* you attempt to spend money, reserve spaces, and perform
other functions that will block on your not having updated the database.

More information about accessing and using the new Database and which
fields need to be updated is posted at: http://web.mit.edu/asa/database/.

Your group's page can be found at https://asa.mit.edu/groups/{{group.pk}}/.


In particular, we believe that your group's entry has the following issues:
{% for prob in problems %}* {{prob}}
{% endfor %}

We appreciate your cooperation in fixing these quickly. If you believe
this message to be in error, please be sure to contact us at
asa-exec@mit.edu.

Thanks,
The ASA Database team

Dear officers of {{group.name}},
   This is a followup to our email earlier this week. You have still not updated your entry in the ASA Database. We have gotten complaints from some MIT offices (e.g., Schedules) that this is delaying their work, and it also interferes with our own work.

*We will fine* groups that haven't updated their records by Monday $50, unless they've contacted us at asa-exec@mit.edu about difficulties doing so.

Additionally, starting Monday Schedules will refuse to reserve rooms if the reserver is not listed in the new database (as opposed to just refering back to the old database, as they have been doing so far).

More information about accessing and using the new Database and which fields need to be updated is posted at: http://web.mit.edu/asa/database/.

Your group's page can be found at https://asa.mit.edu/groups/{{group.pk}}/.


In particular, we believe that your group's entry has the following issues:
{% for prob in problems %}* {{prob}}
{% endfor %}

We appreciate your cooperation in fixing these quickly. If you believe this message to be in error, please be sure to contact us at asa-exec@mit.edu.

Thanks,
The ASA Database team

Hi SAO,
   The following {{num_signatory_records}} signatory updates (of types you care about) have occurred. In addition, since we're sending mail anyway, the following {{num_groups}} groups have updated their information recently.

In total, the following signatory updates by type have occurred:
Added: {{signatory_type_counts.Added}}
Expired: {{signatory_type_counts.Expired}}

Thanks,
ASA Database

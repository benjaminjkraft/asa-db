{{submitter.first_name}} {{submitter.last_name}} submitted the following membership information for {{group.name}}.

Please note, if you are still in the midst of or leading up to your major recruitment period, we encourage you to submit current numbers and a list 
soon to ensure you have something submitted before the deadline. Then you can submit an updated form later, either before or after the deadline. You don't need 
to do this if your membership changes slightly, but we recommend you do so if your numbers change significantly.

In addition to the membership provided by you, please have at least five student members confirm membership using the link below. You do not need to 
have everyone do this, we are simply looking five students' confirmation.  Here is the link to provide to members:

Sincerely,
The ASA Executive Board

<h2>Membership update</h2>

<p>
The ASA is attempting to verify that all currently recognized groups are active
and have at least five members.

<p>
Please select below the groups that you consider yourself a member of. (If you
prefer, you can submit this form whenever one of your groups' leaders asks you
to. Submitting again will not erase previous submissions.)

<tr><th colspan='2'><input type='submit' value='Confirm membership' /></th></tr>

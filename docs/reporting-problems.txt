If you have a problem with the database, we want to hear about it. However, we
get lots of reports like "The database doesn't work for me." or "I get an error
when I search for a group.". While the latter is certainly better, we're
probably still going to have more questions for you. Even when *you* think the
breakage is totally obvious, often we have trouble seeing it. (Sometimes it's
related to the user account, browser, randomness, or time in weird ways that
aren't obvious.)

There's some standard follow-up questions that we'll ask, so if you can include
them in the first place, the reporting process can be much easier.

1) What were you trying to do? (Please include a URL.) If you were filling out
a form and got an error, tell us what you put in and how you submitted the form.

2) What happened? If you got an error message, copy the *exact text* of the
error. Also, did the page look like a normal database page, or was it unthemed?

3) What browser (IE, Firefox, Chrome, etc.) and operating system (Windows, Mac,
etc.) are you using?

4) Were you logged-in when you had the problem? If so, as what username? (Check
the black box in the top-right corner of the database if you don't know.) If
not, what does https://web.mit.edu/certificates/test/ tell you?

5) If applicable, for which group were you trying to use the database?

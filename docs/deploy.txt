Deploying a new version of the ASA database:
* Skim the changes (git log stable..master)
    * verify they're reasonable to deploy
    * make sure any Trac tickets (http://asa.scripts.mit.edu/trac/query) have been marked resolved if applicable
* Draft email to asa-db-core-stakeholders
    git log --oneline stable..master
    git log stable..master > /tmp/commits.txt       # attach
    Summarize any interesting changes
* run locally:
    git checkout stable; git merge master; git checkout master
    git push origin master stable
* run on server
    git pull --ff-only
    ./manage.py migrate
* verify that changes happened and it looks mostly sane
* send the email

I'm a member of the Association of Student Activities Exec board and am working on gathering requirements for a replacement for the ASA Database (https://sisapp.mit.edu/asa/home.do). The current ASA database software is difficult to modify; this is a problem as it is buggy, cumbersome for students and administrators to use, and no longer meets the ASA's needs: for example, the forms to request office space, mailboxes, and bulletin board space do not have the information we need to make these decisions, so we have run one-off forms for these requests separate from the DB for several years.

While Accounts' interaction with the database is more limited than several other offices on campus, you do have some interaction. At the moment, I think your direct interaction is limited to just receiving requests for new lockers and mailing lists to be created. If there's anything we can do to make that more smoothly with the new database, we'd be interested in hearing. We're also interested in whether you see support requests from student groups that a better ASA Database could reduce.

Currently, I plan on developing the database myself over winter break and IAP, rather than the ASA outsourcing it to another group. Consequently, a reply by December 15th would be appreciated.

In general, if you have any concerns or suggestions for this process or the database, I'd appreciate you letting me know.

Thanks,

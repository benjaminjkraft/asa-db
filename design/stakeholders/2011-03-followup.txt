Hi again,

A couple weeks ago, ASA, SAO, CAC, and DSL met to discuss possible plans for organizing development of the ASA Database. At the meeting it became clear that we lacked information abotu what the stakeholders needed out of a new Database development process. This is more preliminary than the specific features that each of our groups said they currently used and wanted from the Database (the topic of my December e-mail), since the sense of the meeting participants was that we needed to know more about how each stakeholder wants to interact with continued development of the ASA Database.

Therefore, I'd like to know:

How often has your office wanted development work (new features, bug fixes, and modifications) on the ASA Database in the last several years?

How much do you expect your office to want *ongoing* development work in the next several years --- specifically, features or modifications that aren't part of possible Database development work this year, but will be wanted in the future because of changing requirements?

As far as changing requirements on your end and desires for future development work, to what degree do you anticipate these to be caused by 1) ASA policy/workflow changes, 2) policy/workflow changes from your office, and 3) changes driven by some third party, comparatively?

If you can provide responses by the end of next week, I'd appreciate it. Once we have this information, I'll schedule another meeting. Please let me know if you'd like to be involved in that meeting --- absent other responses, I'll most likely contact the same people who were present at the last one. At this meeting I hope to propose a draft plan for proceeding with Database development work, based on replies to this e-mail and my December one.

Thanks,
Alex

I'm a member of the Association of Student Activities Exec board and am working on gathering requirements for a replacement for the ASA Database (https://sisapp.mit.edu/asa/home.do). The current ASA database software is difficult to modify; this is a problem as it is buggy, cumbersome for students and administrators to use, and no longer meets the ASA's needs: for example, the forms to request office space, mailboxes, and bulletin board space do not have the information we need to make these decisions, so we have run one-off forms for these requests separate from the DB for several years.

As part of this work, we're trying to determine how we can make the ASA database more useful. At the moment, I don't believe the funding boards have access to the database, and we're wondering if there's access that would be useful.

Several features that we thought might be useful include:
* Sending emails when the officer's list in the database is updated
* Making information like funding status, account numbers, membership numbers available to funding board members

We'd love to hear if there are other features you'd find useful.

Currently, we plan on developing the database ourselves over winter break and IAP, rather than the ASA outsourcing it to another group. Consequently, a reply by December 15th would be appreciated.

In general, if you have any concerns or suggestions for this process or the database, I'd appreciate you letting me know.

Thanks,

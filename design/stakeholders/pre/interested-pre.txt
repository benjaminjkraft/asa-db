Hey people interested in the ASA,

I'm working on gathering requirements for a replacement for the ASA Database (https://sisapp.mit.edu/asa/home.do). The current ASA database software is difficult to modify; this is a problem as it is buggy, cumbersome for students and administrators to use, and no longer meets the ASA's needs: for example, the forms to request office space, mailboxes, and bulletin board space do not have the information we need to make these decisions, so we have run one-off forms for these requests separate from the DB for several years.

If you have suggestions for how the database should change going forward, please let us know.

Currently, we plan on developing the database ourselves over winter break and IAP, rather than the ASA outsourcing it to another group. Consequently, a reply by December 15th would be appreciated.

Once the development is further underway and we have a prototype, we'll be reaching out again, and probably having some pilot groups switch over early.

In general, if you have any concerns or suggestions for this process or the database, I'd appreciate you letting me know.

Thanks,

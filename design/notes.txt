Things to ask stakeholders about:
* Why does SAO use the printed signatory list?
    * Would a more useful signatory report be good for them?
    * Do they want update mail?
* Why does CAC use a printed list?
    * Same as above.
=> [[ Student worker access. If student workers get direct, read-only access, then they can get rid of the lists. ]]
* Ask Accounts if they care about the DB
=> [[ Yes, but not very much. ]]

Stakeholders:
* SAO
* SAFO
* CAC
* Schedules
* Accounts
* Funding boards (UA, GSC)
